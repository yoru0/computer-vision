Hands-on computer vision mini-projects built with Python and OpenCV. Each folder contains a self-contained script that walks through a particular concept.

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run any of the scripts in the subfolders.
